    """A container for counting hashable items.

    The value type must be specified statically, unlike a Python
    Counter, which can accept arbitrary value types.

    The value type must implement the `KeyElement` trait, as its values are
    stored in the dictionary as keys.

    Usage:

    ```mojo
    from collections import Counter
    var c = Counter[String](List("a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "d", "c", "c"))
    print(c["a"]) # prints 3
    print(c["b"]) # prints 2
    ```
    Parameters:
        V: The value type to be counted. Currently must be KeyElement.
    """
